# üå∏ Iris Flower Classification Project üå∏

This project demonstrates the classification of Iris flower species using a Random Forest Classifier. The Iris dataset, a classic dataset in machine learning, is used in this project. Below are the steps taken to achieve the classification.

## üìã Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

You can install them using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## üìÑ Project Overview

1. **Import Libraries**

   - The necessary libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and model building are imported.
2. **Load and Explore the Dataset**

   - The Iris dataset is loaded using pandas.
   - Basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) is performed to understand the dataset's structure and summary statistics.
3. **Display Unique Species**

   - The unique species in the dataset are identified and displayed.
4. **Data Visualization**

   - Boxplots are created for sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width to visualize the distribution of these features.
5. **Encode Species**

   - Species names are encoded into numerical labels for model training.
6. **Split Features and Target**

   - The dataset is split into features and target variables. The target variable is the species of the Iris flowers.
7. **Train-Test Split**

   - The dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.
8. **Train Random Forest Classifier**

   - A Random Forest Classifier is initialized and trained on the training data.
9. **Make Predictions and Evaluate**

   - Predictions are made on the test data.
   - The model's accuracy is calculated, and a classification report is generated to evaluate the model's performance.
10. **Predict Flower Species**

    - A function is defined to predict the species of an Iris flower based on its sepal and petal measurements.
    - Examples of predictions for specific measurements are provided.

## üîç Summary

This project showcases the process of data loading, exploration, visualization, and classification using a Random Forest Classifier on the Iris dataset. The achieved accuracy and classification report indicate the model's performance.
